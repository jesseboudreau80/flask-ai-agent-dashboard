Find a safe location to pull over and turn on your hazard lights.\n2. Loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire using the lug wrench, but do not remove them completely.\n3. Place the jack under the vehicle near the flat tire and raise the car until the flat tire is off the ground.\n4. Remove the lug nuts and take off the flat tire.\n5. Place the spare tire onto the wheel hub and tighten the lug nuts by hand.\n6. Lower the car back to the ground and tighten the lug nuts with the lug wrench in a crisscross pattern.\n7. Check the tire pressure of the spare tire and adjust if necessary.\n8. Pack up your tools and flat tire, and you're ready to go.\n\nIf you have a tire repair kit, you can also try to patch the flat tire instead of using the spare. Follow the instructions on the tire repair kit to seal the puncture. However, it is recommended to replace the flat tire with a spare as soon as possible."
