Vaccine Guidelines 
 
 
Standard Operating Procedure 
Purpose: These guidelines will provide clear guidance for all pet and vet centers 
regarding vaccines and internal parasite control. This is essential for enhancing pet 
health and minimizing the occurrence of contagious disease in our centers. 
Adherence to these guidelines will create a safer and healthier environment for 
both pets and staff.  
 
Destination Pet has adopted the AAHA canine and feline Vaccine 
Guidelines. See included guide. 
Destination Pet highly recommends all dogs and cats be on 
heartworm, flea, and tick prevention.

Frequently Asked Questions 

• 
When recording vaccine information, ensure that you obtain 
verbal or physical confirmation from the pet’s regular 
veterinarian’s office. 
• 
To calculate the expiration date accurately, subtract one day 
from the date of administration, and then add the specified 
duration (in months or years) for the vaccine’s efficacy. 
• 
It is important to enter the correct expiration dates into our 
Point of Sale (POS) system. Accurate data entry ensures that we 
can proactively monitor each pet’s vaccination status and 
uphold compliance with our vaccine guidelines. 
Local Regulations 
• 
In tandem with our internal Vaccine Guidelines, it is also 
paramount that we stay aligned with local regulations. Each 
region may have unique requirements with heath 
considerations. Become familiar with them and ensure 
compliance at your center.
